# tree-width


This repository contains a video game for learning the notion of tree decomposition, used to define the tree-width of an undirected graph.

The graphical user interface proposes to add/remove vertices from the bags. The user has to satisfy the three constraints of a tree decomposition:
  -  Endpoints of each edge should appear in a same bag of the tree decomposition.
  -  Each bag should contain at most k+1 vertices, where k is the tree-width of the graph
  -  The bags containing a given vertex should form a connected component in the tree decomposition.
